# Hi ![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18350557/176309783-0785949b-9127-417c-8b55-ab5a4333674e.gif) I'm David

I'm a **Senior Software Engineer** with a strong background in leading technical teams and developing robust, scalable software solutions. 

Currently, I'm the Tech Lead for the product catalog at [Deporvillage](https://www.deporvillage.com), where I'm responsible for guiding and executing the technical vision for this critical area of the platform. 

My expertise lies in designing and implementing microservices within complex architectural landscapes. I have a keen interest in SRE and DevOps principles, constantly seeking to improve operational efficiency and reliability through automation and best practices. 

I'm a highly motivated and results-oriented individual with a strong desire for continuous learning and improvement. I'm eager to apply new technologies and methodologies to enhance the quality and performance of the software I develop.
